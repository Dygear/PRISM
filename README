PHPInSimMod (PRISM) is alpha software, and should not be used by anyone
who is not brave, or does not know what effect this software may
have on their system.

You must download and install PHP 5.3.0 or better, if not already done so.
You can download PHP from here, http://www.php.net/downloads.php

You should change the Default Timezone cvar within the config/cvar.ini file,
or the value should be set in php.ini. Values can be found here, 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php all you must do is find the value
that is closes to where your server is.

Support can be found here:

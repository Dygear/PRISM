Live for Speed command line options and text commands
=====================================================


Command line options :
----------------------
LFS can be started using a command line or another program.
A dedicated host mode is available with no hardware draw : "nogfx".
Before selecting host options, you may find it helpful to run LFS
and try out the options on the Start New Game screen - the required
upload bandwidth for those options is displayed on screen.

A command line or a command file is required for dedicated hosts.

NOTE - alternative way to use the command line options :

A command file xxx.txt can be used instead of a long command line.
The command file contains the command line parameters.
The parameters can be spread onto several lines.
The command file can contain comments, starting with two slashes //
Then the command line would be simply :

LFS /cfg=xxx.txt (where xxx.txt is the name of the config file)

Host commands :
---------------
Some text commands are intended for hosts and administrators.

Using the normal text message system (pressing T in a normal host or
simply typing into a nogfx host), the message becomes a command if you
start it with a slash character.

Simple commands with no parameter :

/restart             :start a race
/qualify             :start qualifying
/end                 :return to game setup screen
/names               :toggle display between player and user names
/help                :get list of commands
/reinit              :total restart (removes all connections)

/track XXCR          :track and config      (e.g. BL1 / SO3R / FE4)

/qual X              :qualifying minutes    (0 = no qualifying)
/laps X              :number of laps        (0 = practice)

The host commands are also available to any user who has connected to
the host using the admin password if one was specified when the host
was started.


To display a welcome message on a host :
----------------------------------------
Create a text file named "X.txt" in your LFS folder.
Type up to 200 characters into the text file.

Use the command /welcome=X.txt in your startup command line


To restrict the tracks allowed on a host :
------------------------------------------
Create a text file named "X.txt" in your LFS folder.
List all the tracks and configurations you want to allow.
Type one configuration on each line.
You must use the short name of the tracks :
[first two letters of name] [config number] [reversed]

Example :

BL1
BL1R
BL2
BL2R
FE1
FE1R

Use the command /tracks=X.txt in your startup command line


Local commands :
----------------
Most of these text commands replicate functions usually controlled by
pressing on-screen buttons but can be useful in other situations, for
example when controlling LFS from an external program using InSim.

Game setup screen only :

/ready               :set ready
/cancel              :cancel ready
/clear               :clear all racers from list

Game setup screen or in game :

/car XXX             :select car (e.g. XRT)
/setup X             :select setup X
/colour X            :select colour X
/join                :join the race
/ai [NAME]           :add ai driver (can specify NAME)
/spec                :spectate or leave grid
/leave               :disconnect from host
/player X            :select existing player X

/spr X               :run a SP replay from entry (front end) screen
/mpr X               :run a MP replay from entry (front end) screen
/end                 :exit from replay back to entry screen
/sp                  :go into single player from entry screen
/mp IP PORT          :join a local mp game from entry screen

Any time :

/exit                :exit LFS
/entry               :return to entry screen
/speedreduce X       :total speed steer reduction (0 to 1)
/reducehalf X        :speed in m/s for half of reduction

  e.g.  /w pb  (Personal Best)  or  /w laps  (Laps)

  /ws TRACK CAR CMD sends command for specified car/track
  e.g.  /ws BL1R XRT pb  (get PB in XR GT TURBO at Blackwood GP REV)

  More online DB access commands can be found on the
  "LFS Keys" page at www.liveforspeed.net

To get info from master server - /m command  :

  /m find USER : find a user online
  /m ?         : get a list of master commands


Car Strings :
-------------
The /cars command for the startup command line or for hosts / admins
now uses the three-letter S2 car codes.

/cars=MRT            :Allow MRT5 only

These Car Groups can be used as well :

ALL    - all cars
ROAD   - road legal cars
RACE   - race cars
TBO    - same as XRT+RB4+FXO
LRF    - same as LX6+RAC+FZ5
GTR    - same as FXR+XRR+FZR

The plus and minus symbols can be used in conjuction with these :

/cars=TBO+LX4        :Allow XRT, RB4, FXO and LX4
/cars=ROAD-UF1       :Allow all road cars except the UF 1000
